# video-camera
Polymer component for video camera access and for image capture

It can take a snapshot (screenshot/selfie...) of the image when you click on the video or when you invoke the takePicture method.

```html

<video-camera screenshot="{{screen}}"></video-camera>
<img src="{{screen}}"></img>

```
